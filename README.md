Just a simple steganography script. It currently can hide a message into the pixels of an image.
Will improve later.

# Recent Update:
Added support for simple command line arguments

# Future Updates
* Clean the code
* Make it able to store any stort of payload, not just text
* Update comments so that they're easier to read and understand
